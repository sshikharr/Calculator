In this I have made a Calculator using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This project was made while learning about JavaScript. 
I used the onclick function to write my JavaScipt code in HTML document itself. 
I used CSS to give this project a little bit of organized look, for that I used properties like FlexBox, Position etc. 
I have also made this project responsive for all kinds of devices with varying screen widths.
